CSE 5914 Docker Tutorial

## What is Docker?
Docker is a open source software for operating system level virtualization (aka containerization). Software packages, called containers, can be run in the isolated environment, where they can have their configuration files, own libraries, or other configurations in their own environment without getting influenced by others. While isolated, containers can still communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because of its portability and scalability, it can be used widely in different situations and are easier and lighter than some other virtualization methods, such as virtual machines.

### Typical Use Cases:
- Automating the packaging and deployment of applications<br>
- Creation of lightweight, private PAAS environments<br>
- Automated testing and continuous integration/deployment<br>
- Deploying and scaling web apps, databases and backend services<br>
